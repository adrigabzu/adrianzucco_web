abstract: Introduction:  Identifying genetic factors that influence HIV-pathogenesis
  is critical for understanding disease pathways. Previous studies have suggested
  a role for the human gene ten-eleven methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) in modulating
  HIV-pathogenesis. Methods:  We assessed whether genetic variation in TET2 was associated
  with markers of HIV-pathogenesis using both gene level and single nucleotide polymorphism
  (SNP) level association in 8512 HIV-positive persons across five clinical trial
  cohorts. Results:  Variation at both the gene and SNP-level of TET2 was found to
  be associated with levels of HIV viral load (HIV-VL) consistently in the two cohorts
  that recruited antiretroviral-naïve participants. The SNPs occurred in two clusters
  of high linkage disequilibrium (LD), one associated with high HIV-VL and the other
  low HIV-VL, and were predominantly found in Black participants. Conclusion:  Genetic
  variation in TET2 was associated with HIV-VL in two large antiretroviral therapy
  (ART)-naive clinical trial cohorts. The role of TET2 in HIV-pathogenesis warrants
  further investigation.
