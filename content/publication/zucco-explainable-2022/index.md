abstract: 'This thesis aims to present Machine Learning applications for the development
  of precision medicine in patients with infectious diseases. This is outlined by
  proposing computational solutions to two major challenges in precision medicine:
  how to infer relevant host genetic factors in heterogeneous populations (Study I)
  and how to predict patient-specific risk while accounting for censored individuals
  (Study II). For both challenges, the implemented models are explained based on domain
  knowledge of biological systems and disease aetiology supported by methods of model
  interpretability. This corresponds to the secondary aim of developing not only predictive
  models but also deepening the understanding of HIV host genomics and SARS-CoV-2
  risk factors respectively. The specific objectives of each study were:  Study I
  – Associations of functional HLA class I groups with HIV viral load in a heterogeneous
  cohort. To assess if functional clustering of the main host genetic factors involved
  in HIV control, Human Leukocyte Antigen alleles, based on predicted binding affinities
  to HIV peptides facilitate the study of HLA alleles in demographically heterogeneous
  cohorts.  Study II – Personalized survival probabilities for SARS-CoV-2 positive
  patients by explainable machine learning. To implement survival machine learning
  models for predicting personalized 12-week mortality of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
  by leveraging electronic health records and describing temporal dynamics of relevant
  risk factors through model explainability.'
