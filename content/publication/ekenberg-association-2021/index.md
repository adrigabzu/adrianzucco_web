abstract: 'Objectives:  The Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) and
  Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trials demonstrated
  that ART can partly reverse clinically defined immune dysfunction induced by HIV
  replication. As control of HIV replication is influenced by the HLA region, we explored
  whether HLA alleles independently influence the risk of clinical events in HIV+
  individuals. Design:  Cohort study. Methods:  In START and SMART participants, associations
  between imputed HLA alleles and AIDS, infection-related cancer, herpes virus-related
  AIDS events, chronic inflammation-related conditions, and bacterial pneumonia were
  assessed. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for the risk of events
  among allele carriers versus noncarriers. Models were adjusted for sex, age, geography,
  race, time-updated CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV viral load and stratified by treatment
  group within trials. HLA class I and II alleles were analyzed separately. The Benjamini--Hochberg
  procedure was used to limit the false discovery rate to less than 5% (i.e. q value
  textless0.05). Results:  Among 4829 participants, there were 132 AIDS events, 136
  chronic inflammation-related conditions, 167 bacterial pneumonias, 45 infection-related
  cancers, and 49 herpes virus-related AIDS events. Several associations with q value
  less than 0.05 were found: HLA-DQB1∗06:04 and HLA-DRB1∗13:02 with AIDS (adjusted
  HR [95% CI] 2.63 [1.5–4.6] and 2.25 [1.4–3.7], respectively), HLA-B∗15:17 and HLA-DPB1∗15:01
  with bacterial pneumonia (4.93 [2.3–10.7] and 4.33 [2.0–9.3], respectively), and
  HLA-A∗69:01 with infection-related cancer (15.26 [3.5–66.7]). The carriage frequencies
  of these alleles were 10% or less. Conclusion:  This hypothesis-generating study
  suggests that certain HLA alleles may influence the risk of immune dysfunction-related
  events irrespective of viral load and CD4+ T-cell count.'
