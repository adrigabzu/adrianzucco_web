abstract: 'Understanding the genetic interplay between human hosts and infectious
  pathogens is crucial for how we interpret virulence factors. Here, we tested for
  associations between HIV and host genetics, and interactive genetic effects on viral
  load (VL) in HIV-positive antiretroviral treatment-naive clinical trial participants.HIV
  genomes were sequenced and the encoded amino acid (AA) variants were associated
  with VL, human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and imputed HLA alleles using
  generalized linear models with Bonferroni correction.Human (388 501 SNPs) and HIV
  (3010 variants) genetic data were available for 2122 persons. Four HIV variants
  were associated with VL (P &lt; 1.66 × 10–5). Twelve HIV variants were associated
  with a range of 1–512 human SNPs (P &lt; 4.28 × 10–11). We found 46 associations
  between HLA alleles and HIV variants (P &lt; 1.29 × 10–7). HIV variants and immunotypes
  when analyzed separately were associated with lower VL, whereas the opposite was
  true when analyzed in concert. Epitope binding predictions supported our observations.Our
  results show the importance of immunotype specificity on viral antigenic determinants,
  and the identified genetic interplay emphasizes that viral and human genetics should
  be studied in the context of each other.Clinical Trials Registration: NCT00867048.'
