abstract: Spatial resolution in existing chest x-ray (CXR)-based scoring systems for
  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is low, and should be increased for
  better representation of anatomy, and severity of lung involvement. An existing
  CXR-based system, the Brixia score, was modified to increase the spatial resolution,
  creating the MBrixia score. The MBrixia score is the sum, of a rule-based quantification
  of CXR severity on a scale of 0 to 3 in 12 anatomical zones in the lungs. The MBrixia
  score was applied to CXR images from COVID-19 patients at a single tertiary hospital
  in the period May 4th–June 5th, 2020. The relationship between MBrixia score, and
  level of respiratory support at the time of performed CXR imaging was investigated.
  37 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with 290 CXRs were identified, 22 (59.5%) were
  admitted to the intensive care unit and 10 (27%) died during follow-up. In a Poisson
  regression using all 290 MBrixia scored CXRs, a higher MBrixia score was associated
  with a higher level of respiratory support at the time of performed CXR. The MBrixia
  score could potentially be valuable as a quantitative surrogate measurement of COVID-19
  pneumonia severity, and future studies should investigate the score’s validity and
  capabilities of predicting clinical outcomes.
