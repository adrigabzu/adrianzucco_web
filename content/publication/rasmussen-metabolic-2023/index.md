abstract: 'Immune dysfunction resulting from allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (aHSCT) predisposes one to an elevated risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
  Changes in metabolism have been associated with adverse outcomes, and in this study,
  we explored the associations between metabolic profiles and post-transplantation
  CMV infection using plasma samples collected 7–33 days after aHSCT. We included
  68 aHSCT recipients from Rigshospitalet, Denmark, 50% of whom experienced CMV infection
  between days 34–100 post-transplantation. First, we investigated whether 12 metabolites
  selected based on the literature were associated with an increased risk of post-transplantation
  CMV infection. Second, we conducted an exploratory network-based analysis of the
  complete metabolic and lipidomic profiles in relation to clinical phenotypes and
  biological pathways. Lower levels of trimethylamine N-oxide were associated with
  subsequent CMV infection (multivariable logistic regression: OR = 0.63; 95% CI =
  [0.41; 0.87]; p = 0.01). Explorative analysis revealed 12 clusters of metabolites
  or lipids, among which one was predictive of CMV infection, and the others were
  associated with conditioning regimens, age upon aHSCT, CMV serostatus, and/or sex.
  Our results provide evidence for an association between the metabolome and CMV infection
  post-aHSCT that is independent of known risk factors.'
