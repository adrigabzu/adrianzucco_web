abstract: Objective:  Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles are the main host
  genetic factors involved in controlling HIV-1 viral load (VL). Nevertheless, HLA
  diversity has proven a significant challenge in association studies. We assessed
  how accounting for binding affinities of HLA class I alleles to HIV-1 peptides facilitate
  association testing of HLA with HIV-1 VL in a heterogeneous cohort. <br /> **Design**:  Cohort
  from the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study. Methods:  We
  imputed HLA class I alleles from host genetic data (2546 HIV+ participants) and
  sampled immunopeptidomes from 2079 host-paired viral genomes (targeted amplicon
  sequencing). We predicted HLA class I binding affinities to HIV-1 and unspecific
  peptides, grouping alleles into functional clusters through consensus clustering. 
  These functional HLA class I clusters were used to test associations with HIV VL. <br />
  **Results**:  We identified four clades totaling 30 HLA alleles accounting for 11.4%
  variability in VL. We highlight HLA-B∗57:01 and B∗57:03 as functionally similar
  but yet overrepresented in distinct ethnic groups, showing when combined a protective
  association with HIV+ VL (log, β −0.25; adj. P-value textless 0.05). We further
  demonstrate only a slight power reduction when using unspecific immunopeptidomes,
  facilitating the use of the inferred functional HLA groups in other studies <br /> **Conclusion**: 
  The outlined computational approach provides a robust and efficient way to incorporate
  HLA function and peptide diversity, aiding clinical association studies in heterogeneous
  cohorts. To facilitate access to the proposed methods and results we provide an
  interactive application for exploring data.
