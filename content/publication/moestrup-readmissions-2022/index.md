abstract: 'Many interventional in-patient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials
  assess primary outcomes through day 28 post-randomization. Since a proportion of
  patients experience protracted disease or relapse, such follow-up period may not
  fully capture the course of the disease, even when randomization occurs a few days
  after hospitalization.Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in eastern Denmark
  from 18 March 2020–12 January 2021 we assessed all-cause mortality, recovery, and
  sustained recovery 90 days after admission, and readmission and all-cause mortality
  90 days after discharge. Recovery was defined as hospital discharge and sustained
  recovery as recovery and alive without readmissions for 14 consecutive days.Among
  3386 patients included in the study, 2796 (82.6%) reached recovery and 2600 (77.0%)
  achieved sustained recovery. Of those discharged from hospital, 556 (19.9%) were
  readmitted and 289 (10.3%) died. Overall, the median time to recovery was 6 days
  (interquartile range [IQR]: 3–10), and 19 days (IQR: 11–33) among patients in intensive
  care in the first 2 days of admission.Postdischarge readmission and mortality rates
  were substantial. Therefore, sustained recovery should be favored to recovery outcomes
  in clinical COVID-19 trials. A 28-day follow-up period may be too short for the
  critically ill.'
