The overall goal of this use case is to study longitudinal health trajectories - and in particular those leading to cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore it will assess how these trajectories compare across nationwide registries from France, Norway, Finland and Denmark. This project seeks to define health trajectories as the longitudinal sequence of health-related events (e.g. disease diagnoses, medications and hospitalizations) that precede a main outcome of interest, for example, a myocardial infarction.
