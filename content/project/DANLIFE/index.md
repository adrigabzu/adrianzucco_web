The DANish LIFE course cohort (DANLIFE) is a nationwide, register-based, life-course cohort that is based on comprehensive and continuously updated information on social adversity and major life events from the Danish registers. These unique data from a large, unselected population provide an unprecedented resource for testing life-course mechanisms, such as sensitive periods and the accumulation of various stress factors across childhood, adolescence and young adulthood.
