Within public health and epidemiology, these tools have potential to help us uncover the complex patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of diseases emerging from the interplay of biopsychosocial factors. Academically 🎓🦠 I have contributed to the fields of bioinformatics, immunology, and infectious diseases (mainly HIV and COVID-19). More recently, I've broadened my focus to investigate how mental health and societal factors interact with and affects us. Personally 🤔💡 I am committed to challenging limiting assumptions within statistics and biomedical research. I do this by integrating insights from diverse fields such as philosophy, cognitive and contemplative science, causal inference, artificial intelligence, and complexity science. Socially 🔓📢 I advocate for open-source and reproducible research. I also actively explore innovative formats for scientific communication and education, aiming to make complex knowledge accessible to the public.

To understand the patterns underlying the complexity of sleep in this population, we report trends in sleep problems and clusters of life-course factors using Machine Learning on nationwide surveys and registries. Methods: We explored trends in the last decade using data from the Danish National Health Survey, MEDSTAT and The Danish National Patient Registry in self-reported sleep problems, medications such as melatonin and diagnoses for organic and non-organic sleep disorders. We used Natural Language Processing to learn life-course constellations based on registry data from the DANLIFE cohort of 2 million individuals. We then explored clusters of childhood adversity, diagnoses, medications and medical procedures centered around sleep-related medical terms to identify related factors. Results: In the last decade, self-reported sleep problems and sleep medications have been increasing while diagnoses have remained steady. When looking at life-course constellations based on known sleep-related diagnoses, medications and medical procedures we found multiple clusters. Organic clusters involved factors related to respiratory issues, surgical interventions and fatigue from various causes while non-organic clusters were populated by mood and neurodevelopmental disorders. Interventions also differed among clusters where organic clusters had a higher prevalence of pharmacological and medical procedures while non-organic clusters reflected an enrichment in parental counselling and individual psychoeducation.

Our findings can be used to inform antibiotic stewardship and combat the increasing threat of antibiotic resistance.","title":"Impact of Antibiotic Treatment on the Gut Microbiome and Its Resistome in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients","type":"publication"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/j%C3%B8rgensen-mette/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Jørgensen, Mette","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/julian-marc-noguera/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Julian, Marc Noguera","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/lundgren-jens-d/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Lundgren, Jens D","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/macpherson-cameron/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"MacPherson, Cameron","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/marandi-ramtin-z/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Marandi, Ramtin Z","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/moestrup-kasper-sommerlund/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Moestrup, Kasper Sommerlund","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/n%C3%B8rgaard-jens-christian/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Nørgaard, Jens Christian","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/paredes-roger/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Paredes, Roger","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/zucco-adrian-gabriel/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Zucco, Adrian Gabriel","type":"authors"},{"content":"The Copenhagen Health Complexity Center is dedicated to advancing the understanding and management of complex public health challenges, particularly focusing on young adult health, healthcare inequalities, theoretical and methodological development in complexity science, and outreach and public dissemination concerning public health complexity.\n","date":"1 April 2023","externalUrl":"https://healthcomplex.dk/","permalink":"/project/complexity/","section":"Projects","summary":"Member of the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center at the Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen.","title":"Copenhagen Health Complexity Center","type":"project"},{"content":"","date":"1 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/methodology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Methodology","type":"tags"},{"content":"This is a collection of projects I have been involved in, either as a lead or as a collaborator.\n","date":"1 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/project/","section":"Projects","summary":"This is a collection of projects I have been involved in, either as a lead or as a collaborator.","title":"Projects","type":"project"},{"content":" Abstract # Introduction:~ Identifying genetic factors that influence HIV-pathogenesis is critical for understanding disease pathways. Previous studies have suggested a role for the human gene ten-eleven methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) in modulating HIV-pathogenesis. Methods:~ We assessed whether genetic variation in TET2 was associated with markers of HIV-pathogenesis using both gene level and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level association in 8512 HIV-positive persons across five clinical trial cohorts. Results:~ Variation at both the gene and SNP-level of TET2 was found to be associated with levels of HIV viral load (HIV-VL) consistently in the two cohorts that recruited antiretroviral-naïve participants. The SNPs occurred in two clusters of high linkage disequilibrium (LD), one associated with high HIV-VL and the other low HIV-VL, and were predominantly found in Black participants.

This is outlined by proposing computational solutions to two major challenges in precision medicine: how to infer relevant host genetic factors in heterogeneous populations (Study I) and how to predict patient-specific risk while accounting for censored individuals (Study II). For both challenges, the implemented models are explained based on domain knowledge of biological systems and disease aetiology supported by methods of model interpretability. This corresponds to the secondary aim of developing not only predictive models but also deepening the understanding of HIV host genomics and SARS-CoV-2 risk factors respectively. The specific objectives of each study were:  Study I – Associations of functional HLA class I groups with HIV viral load in a heterogeneous cohort. To assess if functional clustering of the main host genetic factors involved in HIV control, Human Leukocyte Antigen alleles, based on predicted binding affinities to HIV peptides facilitate the study of HLA alleles in demographically heterogeneous cohorts.  Study II – Personalized survival probabilities for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients by explainable machine learning. To implement survival machine learning models for predicting personalized 12-week mortality of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients by leveraging electronic health records and describing temporal dynamics of relevant risk factors through model explainability.","title":"Explainable Machine Learning for Precision Medicine of Patients with Infectious Diseases","type":"publication"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/jensen-jens-ulrik-s/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Jensen, Jens Ulrik S","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/jensen-tomas-%C3%B8/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Jensen, Tomas Ø","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/marandi-ramtin-z./","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Marandi, Ramtin Z.","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/moestrup-kasper-s/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Moestrup, Kasper S","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/niemann-carsten-u/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Niemann, Carsten U","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/ostrowski-sisse-r/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Ostrowski, Sisse R","type":"authors"},{"content":" Abstract # Interpretable risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients can aid clinicians to implement precision medicine.

A discrete-time framework for survival modelling enabled us to predict personalized survival curves and explain individual risk factors. Performance on the test set was measured with a weighted concordance index of 0.95 and an area under the curve for precision-recall of 0.71. Age, sex, number of medications, previous hospitalizations and lymphocyte counts were identified as top mortality risk factors. Our explainable survival model developed on EHR data also revealed temporal dynamics of the 22 selected risk factors. Upon further validation, this model may allow direct reporting of personalized survival probabilities in routine care.\nTo cite this publication, please use the following BibTeX entry:\n@article{zuccoPersonalizedSurvivalProbabilities2022, title = {Personalized Survival Probabilities for {{SARS-CoV-2}} Positive Patients by Explainable Machine Learning}, author = {Zucco, Adrian G. and Agius, Rudi and Svanberg, Rebecka and Moestrup, Kasper S. and Marandi, Ramtin Z. and MacPherson, Cameron Ross and Lundgren, Jens and Ostrowski, Sisse R. and Niemann, Carsten U.}, year = {2022}, month = aug, journal = {Scientific Reports}, volume = {12}, number = {1}, pages = {13879}, publisher = {Nature Publishing Group}, issn = {2045-2322}, doi = {10.1038/s41598-022-17953-y}, urldate = {2022-09-04}, copyright = {2022 The Author(s)}, langid = {english}, keywords = {Machine learning,Prognosis,Viral infection}, } ","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publication/xai_sarscov2/","section":"Publications","summary":"Interpretable risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients can aid clinicians to implement precision medicine.

Performance on the test set was measured with a weighted concordance index of 0.95 and an area under the curve for precision-recall of 0.71. Age, sex, number of medications, previous hospitalizations and lymphocyte counts were identified as top mortality risk factors. Our explainable survival model developed on EHR data also revealed temporal dynamics of the 22 selected risk factors. Upon further validation, this model may allow direct reporting of personalized survival probabilities in routine care.","title":"Personalized Survival Probabilities for SARS-CoV-2 Positive Patients by Explainable Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/prognosis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Prognosis","type":"tags"},{"content":" Abstract # Many interventional in-patient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials assess primary outcomes through day 28 post-randomization.

As control of HIV replication is influenced by the HLA region, we explored whether HLA alleles independently influence the risk of clinical events in HIV+ individuals. Design:~ Cohort study. Methods:~ In START and SMART participants, associations between imputed HLA alleles and AIDS, infection-related cancer, herpes virus-related AIDS events, chronic inflammation-related conditions, and bacterial pneumonia were assessed. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for the risk of events among allele carriers versus noncarriers. Models were adjusted for sex, age, geography, race, time-updated CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV viral load and stratified by treatment group within trials. HLA class I and II alleles were analyzed separately. The Benjamini\u0026ndash;Hochberg procedure was used to limit the false discovery rate to less than 5% (i.e. q value $\u0026lt;$0.05). Results:~ Among 4829 participants, there were 132 AIDS events, 136 chronic inflammation-related conditions, 167 bacterial pneumonias, 45 infection-related cancers, and 49 herpes virus-related AIDS events. Several associations with q value less than 0.05 were found: HLA-DQB1$$06:04 and HLA-DRB1$$13:02 with AIDS (adjusted HR [95% CI] 2.63 [1.5\u0026ndash;4.6] and 2.25 [1.4\u0026ndash;3.7], respectively), HLA-B$$15:17 and HLA-DPB1$$15:01 with bacterial pneumonia (4.93 [2.3\u0026ndash;10.7] and 4.33 [2.0\u0026ndash;9.3], respectively), and HLA-A$*$69:01 with infection-related cancer (15.26 [3.5\u0026ndash;66.7]).
