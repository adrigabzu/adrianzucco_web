Within public health and epidemiology, these tools have potential to help us uncover the complex patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of diseases emerging from the interplay of biopsychosocial factors. Academically 🎓🦠 I have contributed to the fields of bioinformatics, immunology, and infectious diseases (mainly HIV and COVID-19). More recently, I've broadened my focus to investigate how mental health and societal factors interact with and affects us. Personally 🤔💡 I am committed to challenging limiting assumptions within statistics and biomedical research. I do this by integrating insights from diverse fields such as philosophy, cognitive and contemplative science, causal inference, artificial intelligence, and complexity science. Socially 🔓📢 I advocate for open-source and reproducible research. I also actively explore innovative formats for scientific communication and education, aiming to make complex knowledge accessible to the public.

To understand the patterns underlying the complexity of sleep in this population, we report trends in sleep problems and clusters of life-course factors using Machine Learning on nationwide surveys and registries. \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eMethods\u003c/strong\u003e:  We explored trends in the last decade using data from the Danish National Health Survey, MEDSTAT and The Danish National Patient Registry in self-reported sleep problems, medications such as melatonin and diagnoses for organic and non-organic sleep disorders. We used Natural Language Processing to learn life-course constellations based on registry data from the DANLIFE cohort of 2 million individuals. We then explored clusters of childhood adversity, diagnoses, medications and medical procedures centered around sleep-related medical terms to identify related factors. \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eResults\u003c/strong\u003e:  In the last decade, self-reported sleep problems and sleep medications have been increasing while diagnoses have remained steady. When looking at life-course constellations based on known sleep-related diagnoses, medications and medical procedures we found multiple clusters. Organic clusters involved factors related to respiratory issues, surgical interventions and fatigue from various causes while non-organic clusters were populated by mood and neurodevelopmental disorders. Interventions also differed among clusters where organic clusters had a higher prevalence of pharmacological and medical procedures while non-organic clusters reflected an enrichment in parental counselling and individual psychoeducation. \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e:  Sleep problems in young adults are increasing. By zooming out to identify clusters and life-course constellations of sleep problems, we provide a basis for zooming into the mechanisms and targeted interventions for young adults.","title":"Defining the landscape of sleep problems in young adults using machine learning on nationwide register data from 2 million individuals","type":"article"},{"content":"","date":"11 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/henning-johannes-drews/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Henning Johannes Drews","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"11 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/jeroen-f.-uleman/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Jeroen F.
