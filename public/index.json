Within public health and epidemiology, these tools have potential to help us uncover the complex patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of diseases emerging from the interplay of biopsychosocial factors. ðŸŽ“ðŸ¦  Academically, I have contributed to the fields of bioinformatics, immunology, and infectious diseases (mainly HIV and COVID-19). More recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve broadened my focus to investigate how mental health and societal factors interact with and affects us. ðŸ¤”ðŸ’¡ Personally, I am committed to challenging limiting assumptions within statistics and biomedical research. I do this by integrating insights from diverse fields such as philosophy, cognitive and contemplative science, causal inference, artificial intelligence, and complexity science. ðŸ”“ðŸ“¢ Socially, I advocate for open-source and reproducible research. I also actively explore innovative formats for scientific communication and education, aiming to make complex knowledge accessible to the public.
